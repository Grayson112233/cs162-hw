3.3.1

* What is the value of argv?

argv is an array of char arrays, so it is a char **.
Each char array in the argv array is a cstring of the command
line arguments (including the executable itself as argv[0])



* What is the value of argv[0]?

argv[0] is a cstring with the first command line argument,
the executable itself. In this case, the binary is:
/home/vagrant/code/personal/hw0/wc
on the vagrant VM



* What is the address of the function main?

Symbol "main" is a function at address 0x40062d.



* Try info stack. Explain what you see.

The only stack frame is for the main function.
It is at line 24 of the source and has two arguments
(argc and argv).



* Try info frame. Explain what you see.

The current selected stack frame is frame 0 (for the main function).
Information includes argument, local, and register addresses
for this frame.



* Try info registers. Which registers are holding aspects
  of the program that you recognize?

Registers rax and rdx appear to be holding the value of the current
char being read from the file. ss is holding the value of the current number
of bytes counted. I cannot find registers holding the same values as my
'newlines' and 'words' counters.
