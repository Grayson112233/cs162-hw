3.3.2

* What file format is used for this binary?
  And what architecture is it compiled for?

The file format is elf64 (64 bit Executable and Linkable Format)
It is compiled for the i386:x86-64 architecture.



* What are some of the names of segment/sections you find?

There are sections for storing data such as text, the GNU version, etc.
Because the executable was compiled with the -g flag, there are also
debugging sections with labels and other info.



* What segment/section contains main (the function) and what is the
  address of main? (It should be the same as what you saw in gdb)

The .text section contains the main function, which has the same address as
seen in gdb (40062d).



* Do you see the stack segment anywhere? What about the heap? Explain.

While there is a STACK header in the executable, there are no stack or heap
sections. This is because the stack and heap are dynamically allocated and not
part of the program data.
